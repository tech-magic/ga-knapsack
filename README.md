# Implementing Knapsack Problem using Genetic Algorithms

## About the Project

This project models a working solution for Knapsack Problem using Genetic Algorithms. Please refer to detailed explanation at 
`Wimal_Perera_Evolutionary_Computing_Assignment.pdf`.

The solution is implemented using ECJ 19 (http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/).

## Running the Project

1. The implementation was tested under java version 1.6.0_17 in Windows Vista operating system. 
2. Go to `Implementation\bin` from command prompt. 
3. Type the command, `java ec.Evolve -file knapsack.params` 
4. If it worked you should get a sample output in the command prompt and also written to a newly created/modified file with name `out.stat`.
